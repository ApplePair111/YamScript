# 🥔 YamScript

**YamScript** is a game engine and scripting language that uses human-readable **YAML** as a block-based alternative to visual coding platforms like Scratch. It runs entirely in the browser using frontend JavaScript — no servers, no install, just code and play.

---

## 🎯 What is YamScript?

YamScript lets you define games using three sections:
- `meta`: Game title, author, etc.
- `sprites`: Sprite names linked to uploaded image IDs
- `code`: Per-sprite logic, with functions like `motion-right`, `math-add`, etc.

Instead of dragging and dropping blocks, you write clean, structured YAML that behaves like Scratch logic.

## 🧠 Features

- ✅ **YAML-based block logic**
- ✅ **Sprite-based 2D games**
- ✅ **Namespaced functions** (like `motion-right`, `visibility-show`)
- ✅ **Fully frontend** – runs in-browser with no backend
- ✅ **Perfect for learning logic without syntax errors**

## 🧩 Core Syntax (Simplified)

**Sections:**
- `meta`: Game title and author
- `sprites`: Define each sprite and its image
- `code`: Assign logic blocks to each sprite

**Function Namespaces:**
- `motion`: Movement functions (`motion-up`, `motion-right`, etc.)
- `visibility`: Show/hide sprite
- `math`: Variable manipulation (`math-add`, etc.)
- `event`: Triggers (e.g. `event-when-key-pressed`)
- `control`: Flow control (`control-repeat`, etc.)

## 🚀 Getting Started

1. Open `applepair.github.io/YamScript` in your browser
2. Write YAML code in the editor
3. Click **Run Game**
4. Watch your logic come to life
